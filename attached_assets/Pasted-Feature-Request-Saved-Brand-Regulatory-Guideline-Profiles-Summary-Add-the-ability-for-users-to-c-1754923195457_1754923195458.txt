Feature Request: Saved Brand & Regulatory Guideline Profiles

Summary
Add the ability for users to create, save, and manage reusable Brand Guidelines and Regulatory Guidelines profiles in their account. This would make guideline management more accessible and efficient, especially for power users, while retaining the current option to manually enter guidelines during each generation.

Details

Manual Entry (Keep Existing)

Maintain the current workflow where users can manually enter brand and regulatory guidelines for every generation.

Saved Profiles (New Feature)

In account settings, allow users to create and name new saved Brand Guideline profiles.

In account settings, allow users to create and name new saved Regulatory Guideline profiles.

Using Saved Profiles in Generators

When opening a generator, users can:

Manually enter guidelines as before.

Or choose from a dropdown of previously saved guidelines (Brand or Regulatory) to auto-populate the fields.

Once populated, fields remain editable for that specific generation.

Quick-Save from Generator

If a user types a guideline in the generator that isn’t already saved, they can choose to save it directly to their account from there.

Profile Management

In account settings:

View all saved guideline profiles.

Rename existing profiles.

Delete profiles they no longer need.
