For brand context pages, I want to be able to have an auto generate feature that takes the home page URL, then crawls the website to find the pages it needs, then auto populates them all.

It should NOT start the extraction when this is used. Users need to confirm they are happy for extraction to commence on the auto populated URL's and be able to edit or replace any they want.

Also confirm that the extracted content for the blogs is then used in all content tools with an instruction along the lines of "Write this article in the same style and using similar language as the existing content"

I can see you already have an auto-populate feature that uses Claude AI to extract brand guidelines from a website. Let me understand your current setup and propose an enhancement.
Should the prompt explicitly say: "Write this article in the same style, tone, and language patterns as the brand context provided above"?

When using content generation tools (make sure this applys to them all now and in the future i.e. not static - dynamic for future tools to be auto included) have a question for the user that asks them if they want the article to mimic the existing style or not. If they select yes - then add to the prompt for that generation, if they say no, then don't

Great idea! This gives users control and makes it dynamic for all future tools. Here's my approach: ## Implementation Plan **The Strategy:** 1. **Reusable Component** - Create a checkbox/toggle in the brand context section that all tools can use 2. **Dynamic Prompt Enhancement** - Update the RAG service to conditionally add style-matching instructions based on user preference 3. **Auto-Application** - Any tool that uses `getBrandContextForPrompt()` automatically gets this feature 4. **Future-Proof** - New tools using the RAG service inherit this behavior automatically **Key Implementation Points:** - Modify `getBrandContextForPrompt()` to accept a `matchStyle` parameter - When `true`, append explicit instruction: *"Write in the same style, tone, and language patterns as the brand context above"* - When `false`, just provide context without style-matching instruction - Add the toggle to all existing content generation forms (SEO Meta, Google Ads, Content Writer v2) This way, any future tool that calls the RAG service will automatically support style matching without additional code! Let me create the task list:
